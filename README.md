This is a chrome extension that's designed to generate quotes, in response to a user's emotions

The application's flow: 
1. The user clicks on the chrome extension's icon, and a grid of emotions appears
2. The user can select an emotion
3. This emotion is sent, as a query, to a REST API, which generates a quote based on that emotion
4. A black overlay, with the quote, appears over the user's active browser window


A visual representation of the application's flow can be seen here:
