This is a chrome extension that's designed to generate quotes, in response to a user's emotions

Here's the application's flow: 
1. The user clicks on the chrome extension's icon, and a grid of emotions appears
2. The user can select an emotion
3. This emotion is sent to an API, which generates a quote based on that emotion
